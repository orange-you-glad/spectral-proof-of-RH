\begin{proof}[Proof of \lemref{lem:inverse_spectral_uniqueness}]
Let \( L \in \TC(\HPsi) \) be a compact, self-adjoint operator with simple, discrete, real spectrum \( \{ \mu_n \}_{n=1}^\infty \), coinciding with that of the canonical operator \( L_{\sym} \). Assume:
\[
\Spec(L) = \Spec(L_{\sym}), \qquad
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L) = \det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_{\sym}), \quad \forall \lambda \in \C.
\]

\paragraph{Step 1: Diagonalization via Spectral Theorem.}
Both \( L \) and \( L_{\sym} \) are compact and self-adjoint with simple spectrum, so each has a unique orthonormal eigenbasis:
\[
L e_n = \mu_n e_n, \qquad L_{\sym} f_n = \mu_n f_n, \qquad \text{for all } n \in \N,
\]
where \( \{e_n\}, \{f_n\} \subset \HPsi \) are orthonormal.

\paragraph{Step 2: Construction of Unitary Intertwiner.}
Define the operator \( U : \HPsi \to \HPsi \) by
\[
U e_n := f_n, \qquad \forall n \in \N.
\]
Since \( U \) maps an orthonormal basis to another, it extends uniquely to a unitary operator with \( U^* U = I = UU^* \).

\paragraph{Step 3: Intertwining Identity.}
For each \( n \in \N \),
\[
U L e_n = \mu_n f_n = L_{\sym} f_n = L_{\sym} U e_n,
\]
so \( U L = L_{\sym} U \), hence
\[
L = U^{-1} L_{\sym} U.
\]

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
The operator \( L \) is unitarily equivalent to \( L_{\sym} \), and this equivalence is rigidly determined by their shared spectrum and global agreement of their zeta-regularized Fredholm determinants. This confirms the inverse spectral uniqueness of the canonical trace-class realization of \( \XiR(s) \).
