\begin{remark}[Multiplicity Compatibility via Hadamard Structure]
\label{rem:hadamard_multiplicity_preservation}

By Hadamard factorization, the multiplicity of any nontrivial zero \( \rho \) of \( \zetaR(s) \) equals the order of vanishing of the canonical determinant at the corresponding spectral value \( \lambda = i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \).

Therefore, if \( \zetaR(s) \) had a multiple zero, the operator \( L_{\sym} \) would exhibit a repeated eigenvalue at \( \mu_\rho := \frac{1}{i}(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \). This ensures full compatibility between the zero multiplicity and the eigenvalue multiplicity encoded by the spectral determinant.

Hence, the genus-one entire structure of \( \XiR(s) \) is faithfully mirrored in the spectral multiplicities of \( L_{\sym} \).
