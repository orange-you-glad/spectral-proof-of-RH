\begin{remark}[Contextual Link to Prologue]
\label{rem:contextual_link_prologue}
The analytic constructions in this chapter are conceptually motivated by the arithmetic heuristics outlined in the Prologue, which relate the canonical determinant identity to the Euler product, Frobenius eigenvalues, and the Weil explicit formula. These connections, while not required for the analytic proofs, provide deep interpretive insight into the spectral encoding of zeta zeros. Readers seeking a geometric or number-theoretic framing for the operator-theoretic machinery developed here are encouraged to review the Prologue before proceeding.
