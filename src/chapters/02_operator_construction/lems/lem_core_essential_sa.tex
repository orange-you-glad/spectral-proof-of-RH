\begin{lemma}[Essential Self-Adjointness on Schwartz Core]
\label{lem:core_essential_sa}
Let \( L_{\sym} \in \TC(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \) be the canonical convolution operator on the exponentially weighted Hilbert space
\[
H_{\Psi_\alpha} := L^2(\R, \Psi_\alpha(x)\, dx), \qquad \Psi_\alpha(x) := e^{\alpha |x|}, \quad \alpha > \pi.
\]
Let \( \Schwartz \subset H_{\Psi_\alpha} \) denote the Schwartz space, which is dense in \( H_{\Psi_\alpha} \), and define
\[
L_0 := L_{\sym} \big|_{\Schwartz}.
\]

Then:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[\textnormal{(i)}] \( L_0 : \Schwartz \to H_{\Psi_\alpha} \) is densely defined and symmetric:
  \[
  \langle L_0 f, g \rangle = \langle f, L_0 g \rangle, \qquad \forall f, g \in \Schwartz,
  \]
  since \( L_{\sym} \) is defined by convolution against a real, even kernel \( k \in \Schwartz \).

  \item[\textnormal{(ii)}] \( L_0 \) is essentially self-adjoint:
  \[
  \overline{L_0} = L_{\sym}, \qquad \text{and} \qquad L_{\sym} = L_{\sym}^*.
  \]
  That is, \( \Schwartz \) is a core for the self-adjoint operator \( L_{\sym} \).
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
\noindent
Thus, \( L_{\sym} \) is essentially self-adjoint on \( \Schwartz \). Since its kernel is smooth, real-valued, even, and decays faster than any exponential (as \( k \in \Schwartz \)), essential self-adjointness follows by Nelsonâ€™s analytic vector theorem~\cite[Thm.~X.36]{ReedSimon1975II}.

\paragraph{Spectral Implications.}
This ensures that the spectral theorem applies to \( L_{\sym} \) with domain determined by the closure of \( \Schwartz \). Consequently, functional calculus, semigroup generation, heat kernels, and zeta regularization are all rigorously well-defined.
\end{lemma}
