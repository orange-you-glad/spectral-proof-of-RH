\begin{definition}[Heat Operator for Compact Self-Adjoint Operators]
\label{def:heat_operator}
Let \( H \) be a separable complex Hilbert space, and let \( L \colon H \to H \) be a compact, self-adjoint, trace-class operator.

Then \( L \) has a discrete real spectrum \( \{ \mu_n \}_{n=1}^\infty \subset \mathbb{R} \), accumulating only at zero, with an associated orthonormal eigenbasis \( \{ e_n \}_{n=1}^\infty \subset H \) satisfying:
\[
L e_n = \mu_n e_n, \qquad \text{with } \mu_n \to 0 \text{ as } n \to \infty.
\]

For each \( t > 0 \), the heat operator is defined via spectral calculus as
\[
e^{-tL^2} := \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-t \mu_n^2} \langle \cdot, e_n \rangle e_n.
\]
This series converges in trace norm, and \( \{ e^{-tL^2} \}_{t > 0} \) defines a strongly continuous, holomorphic, and contractive semigroup on \( H \), generated by the nonnegative self-adjoint operator \( L^2 \).

\medskip
\noindent
The associated heat trace is given by:
\[
\operatorname{Tr}(e^{-tL^2}) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-t \mu_n^2},
\]
with absolute convergence guaranteed by the fact that \( L^2 \in \mathcal{C}_1(H) \).
\end{definition}
