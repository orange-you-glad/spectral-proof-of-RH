\begin{remark}[Logarithmic Singularity and Spectral Zeta Link]
\label{rem:zeta_trace_singularity}
The Laplace transform of the trace \( \Tr(e^{-t L_{\sym}^2}) \) exhibits a logarithmic singularity at \( s = 0 \), reflecting the non-analytic behavior of the spectral zeta function near the origin. This singularity underlies the log-derivative structure of the canonical determinant and is essential to matching the analytic continuation of the completed zeta function \( \Xi(s) \) via the Carleman determinant identity. For precise statements, see \cref{lem:det_via_heat_trace} and \cref{lem:A_log_derivative}.
