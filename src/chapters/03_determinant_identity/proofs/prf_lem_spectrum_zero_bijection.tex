\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{lem:spectrum_zero_bijection}]
Let \( f(\lambda) := \det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_{\sym}) = \Xi\left(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda\right) / \Xi\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right) \), by \cref{thm:det_identity_revised}.

\paragraph{(i) Zero to spectrum direction.}
Let \( \rho \in \C \setminus \{\tfrac{1}{2}\} \) be a nontrivial zero of \( \zeta(s) \), so \( \Xi(\rho) = 0 \). Then \( \lambda_\rho := i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \) is a zero of \( f(\lambda) \).

Since \( L_{\sym} \in \TC(\HPsi) \) is self-adjoint, its determinant has Hadamard factorization
\[
f(\lambda) = \prod_n \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu_n}\right),
\]
where \( \{\mu_n\} \subset \R \setminus \{0\} \) are the eigenvalues of \( L_{\sym} \). So \( \lambda_\rho = \mu_n \) implies
\[
\mu_\rho := \frac{1}{i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2})}
\]
is an eigenvalue of \( L_{\sym} \). The order of vanishing of \( f \) at \( \lambda_\rho \) matches the algebraic multiplicity of \( \mu_\rho \).

\paragraph{(ii) Spectrum to zero direction.}
Suppose \( \mu_n \in \Spec(L_{\sym}) \setminus \{0\} \) is an eigenvalue. Then it appears in the determinant factorization, so its reciprocal
\[
\lambda_n := \mu_n^{-1}
\]
is a zero of \( f(\lambda) \). Therefore, there exists a unique nontrivial zero \( \rho_n \) of \( \zeta(s) \) such that
\[
\lambda_n = i(\rho_n - \tfrac{1}{2}) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \rho_n = \tfrac{1}{2} - i\mu_n^{-1},
\]
with multiplicity matching the order of \( \Xi \) at \( \rho_n \).

\paragraph{(iii) Symmetry and multiplicity preservation.}
The functional equation \( \Xi(s) = \Xi(1 - s) \) ensures that nontrivial zeros come in pairs \( \rho, 1 - \rho \), inducing
\[
\mu_{1 - \rho} = -\mu_\rho,
\]
so the spectrum \( \Spec(L_{\sym}) \) is symmetric about the origin. Since both directions preserve multiplicity, the map
\[
\rho \mapsto \mu_\rho := \tfrac{1}{i}(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2})
\]
defines a bijection between the nontrivial zeros of \( \zeta \) and the nonzero spectrum of \( L_{\sym} \), with multiplicity correspondence. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}
