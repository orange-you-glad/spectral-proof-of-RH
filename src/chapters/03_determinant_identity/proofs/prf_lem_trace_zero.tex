\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{lem:trace_zero}]
Let \( L_{\sym} \in \TC(\HPsi) \) be the canonical self-adjoint convolution operator with kernel
\[
K(x - y) := \ft{\Xi}(x - y),
\]
where
\[
\ft{\Xi}(x) := \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\R} e^{i\lambda x} \, \Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right) \, d\lambda
\]
is the inverse Fourier transform of the centered zeta profile.

\paragraph{(i) Symmetry of the Kernel.}
The profile
\[
\phi(\lambda) := \Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right)
\]
is entire, real-valued, and even due to the functional equation \( \Xi(s) = \Xi(1 - s) \). Consequently, \( \ft{\Xi}(x) \in \Schwartz \) is real-valued and even. In particular, the diagonal value
\[
K(x,x) = \ft{\Xi}(0)
\]
is constant across \( x \in \R \).

\paragraph{(ii) Formal Kernel Trace Heuristic.}
Naively,
\[
\Tr(L_{\sym}) = \int_{\R} K(x,x) \, dx = \ft{\Xi}(0) \cdot \int_{\R} dx,
\]
which diverges unless \( \ft{\Xi}(0) = 0 \). However, this computation is not directly valid in the trace-class setting on weighted spaces and must be justified spectrally.

\paragraph{(iii) Spectral Interpretation via Hadamard Structure.}
The canonical determinant satisfies
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_{\sym}) = \frac{\Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right)}{\Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} \right)},
\]
with Hadamard factorization
\[
\Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right)
= \Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} \right)
\prod_\rho \left( 1 - \frac{\lambda}{i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2})} \right)
\exp\left( \frac{\lambda}{i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2})} \right).
\]
Taking the logarithmic derivative yields
\[
\frac{d}{d\lambda} \log \Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right)
= \sum_\rho \frac{1}{\lambda - i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2})},
\]
which contains no constant term and no pole at \( \lambda = \infty \). In the spectral expansion of \( \log \det_\zeta(I - \lambda L_{\sym}) \), a nonzero trace would appear as a linear term in \( \lambda \), which is absent here. Thus:
\[
\sum_n \lambda_n = \Tr(L_{\sym}) = 0.
\]

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
The trace vanishes:
\[
\Tr(L_{\sym}) = 0,
\]
ensuring that the determinant is normalized at the origin:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I) = 1.
\]
This confirms canonical alignment with the centered zeta profile and its Hadamard structure.
