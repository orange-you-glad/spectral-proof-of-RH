\subsection*{Summary}

This chapter extends the canonical spectral determinant framework from the Riemann zeta function to the class of completed automorphic \( L \)-functions \( \Xi(s, \pi) \), where \( \pi \in \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{cusp}}(\GL_n) \) is a unitary cuspidal automorphic representation. Assuming standard analytic continuation and boundedness properties for \( \Xi(s, \pi) \), along with exponential decay of its inverse Fourier transform, we constructed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A family of mollified convolution operators \( \{ \Ltpi \}_{t > 0} \subset \TC(\Hpsipi) \), with exponential kernel decay and uniform trace-norm control;

  \item A canonical limit operator \( \Lsympi \in \TC(\Hpsipi) \), obtained via trace-norm convergence, satisfying the determinant identity
  \[
  \detz(I - \lambda \Lsympi) = \frac{\Xi\left(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda, \pi\right)}{\Xi\left(\tfrac{1}{2}, \pi\right)};
  \]

  \item A multiplicity-preserving spectral encoding
  \[
  \rho \mapsto \mu_\rho := \frac{1}{i}(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \in \Spec(\Lsympi),
  \]
  matching the nontrivial zeros of \( L(s, \pi) \) with the nonzero spectrum of \( \Lsympi \);

  \item A spectral equivalence:
  \[
  \GRH(\pi) \iff \Spec(\Lsympi) \subset \R,
  \]
  generalizing the RH \( \iff \) spectrum reality equivalence to the automorphic setting.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

These results validate the extension of the analyticâ€“spectral framework from \( \zeta(s) \) to all \( \GL_n \)-automorphic representations, conditional on standard analytic properties of \( \Xi(s, \pi) \) and kernel localization. The structure is modular, zeta-compatible, and uniform across automorphic rank. This provides a blueprint for future extensions to motivic, Artin, and non-\( \GL_n \) \( L \)-functions, as outlined in \appref{app:functorial_extensions}.

\medskip

The next chapter returns to the Riemann case and completes the logical closure of the spectral program, formally establishing the equivalence
\[
\RH \iff \Spec(\Lsym) \subset \R,
\]
within the fully validated determinant and spectral structure of the canonical operator \( \Lsym \).
