\subsection*{Introduction}

This chapter concludes the analytic–spectral phase of the proof architecture by extracting two definitive consequences from the canonical determinant identity (Theorem~\ref{thm:det-identity-revised}):

\begin{itemize}
  \item A formal equivalence lemma (Lemma~\ref{lem:reality-of-spectrum-and-rh}): \emph{RH holds if and only if the spectrum of the canonical operator \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \) is real};

  \item A spectral uniqueness theorem: \emph{Any compact, self-adjoint, trace-class operator realizing the normalized determinant identity for \( \Xi(s) \) is unitarily equivalent to \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \)}.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

These yield the following precise implications:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to the spectral reality of the canonical operator:
  \[
  \mathrm{RH} \iff \operatorname{Spec}(L_{\mathrm{sym}}) \subset \mathbb{R},
  \]
  proven constructively in Lemma~\ref{lem:reality-of-spectrum-and-rh} and summarized in Corollary~\ref{cor:spectrum-real-equiv-rh};

  \item Let \( L \in \mathcal{S}_1(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \) be any compact, self-adjoint operator satisfying
  \[
  \det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L) = \frac{\Xi(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda)}{\Xi(\tfrac{1}{2})}, \quad \text{for all } \lambda \in \mathbb{C}.
  \]
  Then \( L \) is unitarily equivalent to \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \). That is, \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \) is unique (up to unitary equivalence) within the trace-class realization space of \( \Xi \).
\end{itemize}

\medskip

Taken together, these results establish the following operator-theoretic principle:

\begin{quote}
  The analytic structure of the completed Riemann zeta function \( \Xi(s) \), through its Hadamard product and functional symmetry, canonically determines a unique (up to unitary equivalence) compact, self-adjoint, trace-class operator whose spectrum encodes the Riemann Hypothesis via spectral reality.
\end{quote}

This identification finalizes the analytic–spectral segment of the modular proof. It provides a logically acyclic reformulation of RH within the framework of Fredholm theory, trace-class spectral calculus, and Carleman \(\zeta\)-regularized determinant identities.
