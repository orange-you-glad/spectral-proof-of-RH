\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:hadamard_linear_form}]
Let \( F(\lambda) := \Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right) \). Since \( \Xi(s) \) is entire of order one and genus one, Hadamardâ€™s factorization theorem \cite[Theorem~3.7.1]{Levin1996EntireLectures} implies that
\[
\Xi(s) = e^{A + B s} \prod_{\rho} \left( 1 - \frac{s}{\rho} \right) \exp\left( \frac{s}{\rho} \right),
\]
where the product is over all nontrivial zeros \( \rho \) of \( \zeta(s) \), counted with multiplicity. This product converges absolutely since \( \sum_\rho |\rho|^{-2} < \infty \) due to the order-1 growth of \( \Xi \).

\medskip
Now define the change of variables \( \lambda := -i(s - \tfrac{1}{2}) \), so \( s = \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \). Each zero \( \rho \ne \tfrac{1}{2} \) corresponds to
\[
\lambda_\rho := i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}),
\]
and the zero set of \( F(\lambda) := \Xi(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda) \) is exactly \( \{ \lambda_\rho \}_{\rho \ne \tfrac{1}{2}} \), symmetric about the origin.

Substituting into the Hadamard product gives
\[
F(\lambda) = e^{C_0 + C_1 \lambda} \prod_{\rho \ne \tfrac{1}{2}} \left( 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_\rho} \right) \exp\left( \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_\rho} \right),
\]
where \( C_0, C_1 \in \mathbb{C} \) are constants of integration from Hadamard's theorem.

\medskip
By the functional equation \( \Xi(s) = \Xi(1 - s) \), it follows that \( F(\lambda) = F(-\lambda) \), so \( F \) is an even function. This symmetry forces \( C_1 = 0 \), leaving
\[
F(\lambda) = e^{C_0} \prod_{\rho \ne \tfrac{1}{2}} \left( 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_\rho} \right) \exp\left( \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_\rho} \right).
\]

Evaluating at \( \lambda = 0 \) gives
\[
F(0) = \Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} \right) = e^{C_0},
\]
so \( C_0 = \log \Xi(\tfrac{1}{2}) \), and we conclude
\[
\Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right)
= \Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} \right) \prod_{\rho \ne \tfrac{1}{2}} \left( 1 - \frac{\lambda}{i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2})} \right) \exp\left( \frac{\lambda}{i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2})} \right),
\]
which completes the proof.
