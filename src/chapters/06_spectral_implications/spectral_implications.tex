% Physics analogy remark
\begin{remark}[Spectral Physics Perspective]
The equivalence \( \mathrm{RH} \iff \operatorname{Spec}(L_{\mathrm{sym}}) \subset \mathbb{R} \) admits a speculative interpretation in the context of quantum mechanics. Under the spectral map \( \rho = \tfrac{1}{2} + i\gamma \mapsto \mu_\rho := \tfrac{1}{\gamma} \), the canonical operator \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \) can be formally viewed as a Hamiltonian with inverse arithmetic energy levels. Its heat trace resembles a quantum partition function with singular short-time behavior, and its determinant has parallels with spectral free energy. See Appendix~\ref{app:spectral-physics-link} for further discussion of this physical analogy.
\end{remark}

% Determinant trace-log identity is used but not proved here

\noindent
For the analytic justification of the trace–logarithmic derivative identity, see Lemma~\ref{lem:log-derivative-determinant} in Chapter~\ref{sec:heat-kernel-asymptotics} and the supporting analysis in Appendix~\ref{app:heat-kernel-construction}.

\subsection{Uniqueness of Spectral Realization}

% This result builds directly on the spectral-zero bijection and the determinant identity,
% enforcing uniqueness within the trace-class, self-adjoint realization space.
