\begin{remark}[Spectral Physics Interpretation]
\label{rmk:spectral_physics_analogy}
The equivalence \(\RH \iff \Spec(L_{\sym}) \subset \R\) admits a heuristic analogy from quantum theory. Under the reparametrization \(\rho = \tfrac{1}{2} + i\gamma \mapsto \mu_\rho := \tfrac{1}{\gamma}\), the operator \(L_{\sym}\) resembles a quantum Hamiltonian with inverse arithmetic energy levels. Its trace-class heat semigroup behaves like a quantum partition function with singular short-time scaling, while the spectral determinant plays the role of a regularized free energy. See \appref{app:spectral_physics_link} for further discussion.
