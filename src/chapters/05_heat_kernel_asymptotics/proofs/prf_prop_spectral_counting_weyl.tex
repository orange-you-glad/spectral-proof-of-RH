\begin{proof}[Proof of \propref{prop:spectral_counting_weyl}]
From the refined short-time asymptotic of the spectral heat trace (see \propref{prop:short_time_heat_expansion}), we have:
\[
\Theta(t) := \Tr(e^{-t L_{\sym}^2}) \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi t}} \log\left( \frac{1}{t} \right), \qquad \text{as } t \to 0^+.
\]

Let \( \{ \mu_n^2 \} \subset (0, \infty) \) denote the nonzero eigenvalues of \( L_{\sym}^2 \), counted with multiplicity, and define the squared spectral counting function:
\[
N(\lambda) := \#\left\{ n \in \N : \mu_n^2 \le \lambda \right\}.
\]

By Korevaar’s log-corrected Tauberian theorem~\cite[Ch.~III, §5]{Korevaar2004Tauberian}, as applied rigorously in \lemref{lem:log_corrected_tauberian_estimate}, the asymptotic behavior of \( \Theta(t) \) implies:
\[
N(\lambda) = \frac{\sqrt{\lambda}}{\pi} \log \lambda + O(\sqrt{\lambda}), \qquad \text{as } \lambda \to \infty.
\]

The logarithmic enhancement reflects the spectral density imposed by the leading singularity in the heat trace and modifies the classical Weyl law for effective spectral dimension \( d = 1 \).

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
The singular trace asymptotics invert via Laplace–Stieltjes theory to yield the log-modulated Weyl-type growth of the eigenvalue counting function:
\[
N(\lambda) \in \mathcal{R}_{1/2}^{\log}(\infty),
\]
establishing the spectral growth profile consistent with the canonical zeta determinant and the Riemann–von Mangoldt formula.
\end{proof}
