# 🪦 Spectral Proof Graveyard

Welcome to the **Spectral Proof Graveyard** — a repository of ideas, attempts, and drafts that marked the intellectual journey toward the current spectral formulation of the Riemann Hypothesis. These materials were created along the way as I explored mathematics, learned the foundations of spectral theory, and developed the framework now formalized elsewhere in this project.

## 📚 Purpose

This directory serves as a historical archive — a transparent record of the path from intuition to rigor. The documents here include:

- Early drafts of the spectral proof
- Abandoned approaches and dead ends
- Versions produced during learning phases
- Exploratory models and math exercises
- Internal notes and speculative detours

While these documents do not represent final or citable research, they are preserved as a testament to the learning process and the iterative nature of mathematical discovery.

## ❌ Citation Disclaimer

> ⚠️ **Do not cite any material from this directory.**  
> These documents are not peer-reviewed, contain mathematical errors, and have been superseded by newer formalizations. They are preserved solely for educational and archival purposes.

## 📁 Contents

- `README.md` – This file.
- `*.pdf` – Various versions and drafts of the spectral proof, often differing significantly in approach and maturity.

## 💬 Philosophy

Mathematics is as much about failing intelligently as it is about proving things rigorously. This graveyard is not a failure — it's a fossil record of growth, curiosity, and resilience.
