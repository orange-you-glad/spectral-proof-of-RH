\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:spectral_bijection_consistency}]
Let \( \rho = \tfrac{1}{2} + i\gamma \) be a nontrivial zero of \( \zeta(s) \), and define
\[
\mu_\rho := \frac{1}{i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2})}.
\]

\paragraph{Bijection Properties.}
The following properties are established in earlier results:

\begin{itemize}
  \item By Lemma~\ref{lem:zero-to-eigenvalue-injection}, each nontrivial zero \( \rho \) maps to a nonzero eigenvalue \( \mu_\rho \in \Spec(L_{\mathrm{sym}}) \), and this map is injective with multiplicity preserved.

  \item Lemma~\ref{lem:spectral_exhaustivity} shows that every nonzero eigenvalue \( \mu \in \Spec(L_{\mathrm{sym}}) \setminus \{0\} \) arises from such a \( \rho \), establishing surjectivity of the map.

  \item Lemma~\ref{lem:spectral-multiplicity-matching} confirms that the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue \( \mu_\rho \) equals the order of vanishing of \( \zeta(s) \) at \( \rho \).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
Therefore, the map
\[
\rho \mapsto \mu_\rho := \frac{1}{i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2})}
\]
is a bijection of multisets between the nontrivial zeros of \( \zeta(s) \) and the nonzero spectrum of \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \), preserving algebraic multiplicities. This completes the canonical spectral correspondence enforced by the determinant identity.
\end{proof}
