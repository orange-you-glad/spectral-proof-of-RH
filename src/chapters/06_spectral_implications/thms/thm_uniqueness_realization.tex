\begin{theorem}[Uniqueness of Spectral Realization]
\label{thm:uniqueness_realization}

Let \( L \in \mathcal{C}_1(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \cap \mathcal{K}(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \) be a compact, self-adjoint, trace-class operator on the exponentially weighted Hilbert space
\[
H_{\Psi_\alpha} := L^2(\mathbb{R}, e^{\alpha |x|} \, dx), \qquad \alpha > \pi.
\]

Suppose \( L \) satisfies the canonical zeta-regularized determinant identity:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L) = \frac{\Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right)}{\Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} \right)},
\quad \forall \lambda \in \mathbb{C},
\]
where \( \Xi(s) \) is the completed Riemann zeta function, entire of order one and exact exponential type \( \pi \). Assume the normalization:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I) = 1.
\]

Then \( L \) is unitarily equivalent to the canonical operator \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \in \mathcal{C}_1(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \). That is, there exists a unitary operator
\[
U \colon H_{\Psi_\alpha} \to H_{\Psi_\alpha} \quad \text{such that} \quad L = U L_{\mathrm{sym}} U^{-1}.
\]

\medskip
\noindent
In particular:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The spectrum of \( L \), including all algebraic multiplicities, coincides with that of \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \);
  \item \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \) is the unique (up to unitary equivalence) compact, self-adjoint, trace-class realization of the completed zeta function’s canonical spectral determinant;
  \item The analytic data encoded in \( \Xi(s) \)—via its Hadamard factorization and spectral trace regularization—rigidly determines the operator-theoretic structure of \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \).
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
