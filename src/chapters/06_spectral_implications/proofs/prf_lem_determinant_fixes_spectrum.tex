\begin{proof}[Proof of \lemref{lem:determinant_fixes_spectrum}]
Let \( f(\lambda) := \det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L) \), and suppose
\[
f(\lambda) = \frac{\XiR(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda)}{\XiR(\tfrac{1}{2})}
= \det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_{\sym}),
\quad \forall \lambda \in \C,
\]
where \( L \in \TC(\HPsi) \cap \KC(\HPsi) \) is compact, self-adjoint, trace-class, and satisfies \( \Tr(L) = 0 \).

\paragraph{Step 1: Entire Function Identity and Trace Normalization.}
Both determinant functions are entire of order one and exponential type \( \pi \), and normalized so that \( f(0) = 1 \). The trace-zero condition removes any exponential prefactor ambiguity in their Hadamard factorizationâ€”i.e., no term of the form \( e^{a\lambda} \) appears.

\paragraph{Step 2: Logarithmic Derivative and Spectral Poles.}
The logarithmic derivative of the determinant is governed by the resolvent trace formula:
\[
\frac{d}{d\lambda} \log f(\lambda)
= \Tr\left[(I - \lambda L)^{-1} L\right],
\]
which is meromorphic with simple poles at \( \lambda = 1/\mu \) for each nonzero eigenvalue \( \mu \in \Spec(L) \), with residue equal to the algebraic multiplicity of \( \mu \).

Since the determinant agrees with that of \( L_{\sym} \), these poles match those of the canonical model, and thus:
\[
\Spec(L) \setminus \{0\} = \Spec(L_{\sym}) \setminus \{0\}
\quad \text{as multisets}.
\]

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
The spectral data of \( L \), away from zero, is completely encoded by the determinant under the trace normalization condition. Therefore, \( L \) and \( L_{\sym} \) have identical nonzero spectra, completing the proof.
\end{proof}
