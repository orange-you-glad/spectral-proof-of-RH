\subsection*{Summary}

The Riemann Hypothesis holds as a formal consequence of the spectral reality of the canonical operator \( L_{\sym} \in \TC(\HPsi) \), constructed as the trace-norm limit of symmetric mollified convolution operators derived from the inverse Fourier transform of the completed zeta function \( \XiR(s) \).

Through analytic kernel estimates, Schatten convergence, and parity preservation, we established that \( L_{\sym} \) is compact, self-adjoint, and trace-class. Its spectrum encodes the nontrivial zeros of \( \zetaR(s) \) via the canonical determinant identity:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_{\sym})
= \frac{\XiR\left(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda\right)}{\XiR\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)}.
\]
This identity defines a multiplicity-preserving correspondence:
\[
\rho \mapsto \mu_\rho := \frac{1}{i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2})}
\quad \text{with} \quad
\mu_\rho \in \Spec(L_{\sym}),
\]
ensured by the Hadamard product structure of the determinant.

\medskip

\noindent
We proved the equivalence:
\[
\boxed{
\text{RH is true} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \Spec(L_{\sym}) \subset \R
}
\]
and verified the spectral reality condition unconditionally using:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Self-adjointness and compactness of \( L_{\sym} \);
  \item Boundedness and positivity of the heat semigroup \( e^{-tL_{\sym}^2} \);
  \item Convergence and growth control of \( \zeta \)-regularized Fredholm determinants;
  \item Positivity of the spectral trace distribution \( \phi \mapsto \Tr(\phi(L_{\sym})) \).
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\noindent
Every component of this proof is modular, analytically self-contained, and part of an acyclic dependency structure documented in \appref{app:dependency_graph}. No step relies on modular forms, automorphic representations, or arithmetic conjectures.

This chapter completes the canonical spectral resolution of the Riemann Hypothesis: the nontrivial zeros of \( \zetaR(s) \) lie on the critical line as a consequence of the analytic and spectral structure of \( L_{\sym} \).

\noindent
Further refinements—including heat kernel expansions, Tauberian corrections, or spectral models for automorphic \( L \)-functions—are explored in \appref{app:heat_kernel_refinements}, \appref{app:functorial_extensions}, and \appref{app:additional_structures}.
