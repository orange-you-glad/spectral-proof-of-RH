\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:laplace-heat-trace-convergence}]
Let \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \in \mathcal{C}_1(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \) be the canonical operator as constructed in Chapter~\ref{sec:operator-construction}. For all \( t > 0 \), the operator \( e^{-t L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2} \) is trace-class by the spectral theorem and closure of \( \mathcal{C}_1 \) under holomorphic functional calculus. In particular, the trace function
\[
t \mapsto \operatorname{Tr}(e^{-t L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2})
\]
is smooth and positive for \( t > 0 \), and the semigroup \( \{ e^{-t L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2} \}_{t>0} \) is strongly continuous and holomorphic in \( t \).

\smallskip
\noindent
From the short-time heat kernel expansion in Chapter~\ref{sec:heat-kernel-asymptotics}, we know:
\[
\operatorname{Tr}(e^{-t L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2}) \lesssim t^{-1/2} \quad \text{as } t \to 0^+,
\]
with constants uniform in compact neighborhoods. Moreover, from the exponential decay of the kernel spectrum and the smoothing property of \( L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2 \), we have rapid decay:
\[
\operatorname{Tr}(e^{-t L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2}) \lesssim e^{-ct} \quad \text{as } t \to \infty,
\]
for some constant \( c > 0 \).

\smallskip
\noindent
The Laplace transform defining the Carleman determinant then reads:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_{\mathrm{sym}}) = \exp\left(- \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-\lambda^2 t}}{t} \operatorname{Tr}(e^{-t L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2}) \, dt \right),
\]
and converges absolutely for all \( \lambda \in \mathbb{C} \) by comparison to \( \int_0^\infty t^{-3/2} e^{-\lambda^2 t} dt < \infty \), using the short-time asymptotic bound.

\smallskip
\noindent
Finally, since the Laplace transform of a trace-class heat kernel defines an entire function whose order is governed by the exponential decay of the trace, and the exponential type of the spectral kernel is exactly \( \pi \) (see Lemma~\ref{lem:det_identity_entire_order_one}), the determinant is entire of order one and exponential type \( \pi \), completing the proof.
