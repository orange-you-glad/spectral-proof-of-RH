\begin{proof}[Proof of \lemref{lem:heat_kernel_diagonal_positivity}]
Since \( L_{\sym} \in \TC(\HPsi) \) is compact, self-adjoint, and defined on the weighted Hilbert space \( \HPsi = L^2(\R, e^{\alpha|x|} dx) \), the spectral theorem yields an orthonormal basis \( \{e_n\}_{n \geq 1} \subset \HPsi \) of eigenfunctions with corresponding real eigenvalues \( \mu_n \in \R \), satisfying \( \mu_n \to 0 \). Then for all \( t > 0 \), the heat operator \( e^{-t L_{\sym}^2} \) is trace class and admits the spectral expansion:
\[
K_t(x,y) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-t \mu_n^2} \, e_n(x) \, \overline{e_n(y)},
\]
with convergence in the Hilbert--Schmidt norm topology and pointwise absolutely for each fixed \( (x,y) \in \R^2 \), due to the trace-class property of \( e^{-t L_{\sym}^2} \).

Restricting to the diagonal \( x = y \), we obtain
\[
K_t(x,x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-t \mu_n^2} \, |e_n(x)|^2.
\]
Each term in the sum is nonnegative, and since \( \sum_{n} e^{-t \mu_n^2} < \infty \), the convergence is absolute and locally uniform in \( x \in \R \). Therefore,
\[
K_t(x,x) \geq 0, \qquad \forall x \in \R, \; t > 0.
\]

This proves pointwise nonnegativity of the heat kernel along the diagonal.
\end{proof}
