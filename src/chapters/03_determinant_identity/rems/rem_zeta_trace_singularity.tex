\begin{remark}
The Laplace transform of the trace of \( e^{-t L_{\sym}^2} \) exhibits a logarithmic singularity at \( s = 0 \), which aligns with the logarithmic derivative structure of the spectral zeta function. This growth behavior is key to matching the analytic continuation of the completed zeta function via the Carleman determinant. See \lemref{lem:det_via_heat_trace} and \lemref{lem:A_log_derivative}.
