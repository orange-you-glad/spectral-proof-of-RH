\begin{proof}[Proof of \thmref{thm:zero_encoding_general}]
By \thmref{thm:spectral_determinant_identity_Lpi}, the zeta-regularized Fredholm determinant of \( \Lsympi \in \TC(\Hpsipi) \) satisfies
\[
\detz(I - \lambda \Lsympi) = \frac{\Xi\left(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda, \pi\right)}{\Xi\left(\tfrac{1}{2}, \pi\right)}.
\]
This identity is obtained from mollified convolution approximations under the analytic decay assumption in \defref{def:kernel_decay_condition}, and the limit construction is justified by \lemref{lem:trace_class_convergence_general}.

Since the determinant function \( \detz(I - \lambda \Lsympi) \) is entire of order one, its zeros occur precisely at the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of \( \Lsympi \), scaled as \( \mu = \frac{1}{i}(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \), where \( \rho \in \C \) is a nontrivial zero of \( \Xi(s, \pi) \).

Let \( \mu \in \Spec(\Lsympi) \). Then \( \lambda = \mu \) is a zero of \( \detz(I - \lambda \Lsympi) \), which implies that
\[
\Xi\left(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\mu, \pi\right) = 0.
\]
Set \( \rho := \tfrac{1}{2} + i\mu \). Then \( \Xi(\rho, \pi) = 0 \), and \( \mu = \frac{1}{i}(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \) as claimed.

Multiplicity of the zero \( \rho \) in \( \Xi(s, \pi) \) corresponds to the multiplicity of the eigenvalue \( \mu_\rho \) in the spectrum of \( \Lsympi \), since the regularized determinant encodes the full spectral data via the Hadamard factorization of entire functions of order one (cf.~\cite[Ch.~2]{Levin1996EntireLectures}).

Hence,
\[
\Spec(\Lsympi) = \left\{ \mu_\rho := \tfrac{1}{i}(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) : \Xi(\rho, \pi) = 0 \right\},
\]
with multiplicities preserved.
\end{proof}
