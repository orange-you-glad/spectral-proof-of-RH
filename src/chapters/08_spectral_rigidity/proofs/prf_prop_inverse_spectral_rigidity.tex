\begin{proof}[Proof of \propref{prop:inverse_spectral_rigidity}]
Let \( L_1, L_2 \in \mathcal{C}_1(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \) be compact, self-adjoint operators satisfying:
\[
\operatorname{Spec}(L_1) = \operatorname{Spec}(L_2), \qquad
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_1) = \det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_2), \quad \forall \lambda \in \mathbb{C}.
\]

\paragraph{Step 1: Spectral Theorem and Orthonormal Bases.}
By the spectral theorem, each \( L_j \) admits an orthonormal basis \( \{e_n^{(j)}\} \subset H_{\Psi_\alpha} \) with corresponding eigenvalues \( \{\lambda_n\} \subset \mathbb{R} \), repeated with multiplicities, satisfying:
\[
L_j f = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \lambda_n \langle f, e_n^{(j)} \rangle e_n^{(j)}, \quad j = 1,2.
\]

\paragraph{Step 2: Determinant Equivalence.}
Since each operator is trace class, its Carleman determinant is given by:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_j) = \prod_{n=1}^\infty (1 - \lambda \lambda_n),
\]
which converges absolutely on compact subsets of \( \mathbb{C} \). Equality of determinants for all \( \lambda \in \mathbb{C} \) implies equality of their Hadamard product expansions, and thus the spectrum agrees identically, including multiplicities.

\paragraph{Step 3: Construction of Intertwiner.}
Define a unitary operator \( U \colon H_{\Psi_\alpha} \to H_{\Psi_\alpha} \) by \( U e_n^{(1)} := e_n^{(2)} \). This defines an isometry and yields:
\[
U L_1 U^{-1} f = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \lambda_n \langle f, e_n^{(2)} \rangle e_n^{(2)} = L_2 f.
\]
Hence,
\[
L_2 = U L_1 U^{-1}.
\]

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
The operators \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) are unitarily equivalent. If both arise from the canonical determinant identity for \( \Xi(s) \), then this unitary equivalence coincides with identity, and \( L_1 = L_2 \) by uniqueness of the canonical convolution model.
\end{proof}
