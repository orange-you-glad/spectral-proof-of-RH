\begin{remark}[Forward Reference: Spectral Reality and RH Equivalence]
\label{rmk:rh_equivalence_forward_ref}
The mapping \( \rho \mapsto \mu_\rho := \frac{1}{i}(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \) encodes the nontrivial zeros of the completed zeta function into the spectrum of the canonical operator \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \in \mathcal{C}_1(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \). 

The full equivalence between the Riemann Hypothesis and the spectral condition
\[
\Spec(L_{\mathrm{sym}}) \subset \mathbb{R}
\]
is formally established later in \lemref{lem:reality_of_spectrum_and_rh} (Chapter~6). This equivalence completes the operator-theoretic restatement of RH.
