\begin{proof}[Proof of \thmref{thm:sa_trace_class_Lsym}]
Let \( L_{\sym} \) denote the canonical convolution operator acting on
\[
H_{\Psi_\alpha} := L^2(\R, \Psi_\alpha(x)\, dx), \qquad \Psi_\alpha(x) := e^{\alpha |x|}, \quad \alpha > \pi.
\]

\paragraph{(i) Trace-Class and Compactness.}
By \lemref{lem:trace_norm_convergence_Lt_to_Lsym}, we have
\[
L_t \to L_{\sym} \quad \text{in } \TC(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \quad \text{as } t \to 0^+,
\]
where each \( L_t \in \TC(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \) by \lemref{lem:trace_class_Lt}. Since \( \TC \) is a Banach ideal, closed under norm convergence, it follows that
\[
L_{\sym} \in \TC(H_{\Psi_\alpha}).
\]
Moreover, every trace-class operator is compact, so
\[
L_{\sym} \in \KC(H_{\Psi_\alpha}).
\]

\paragraph{(ii) Self-Adjointness via Core Domain.}
By \lemref{lem:core_essential_sa}, the restriction \( L_0 := L_{\sym}|_{\Schwartz} \) is symmetric and essentially self-adjoint. Since \( \Schwartz \subset H_{\Psi_\alpha} \) is dense and preserved by convolution, the closure satisfies:
\[
\overline{L_0} = L_{\sym}, \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad L_{\sym} = L_{\sym}^*.
\]

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
We conclude that
\[
L_{\sym} \in \TC(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \cap \KC(H_{\Psi_\alpha}), \qquad L_{\sym} = L_{\sym}^*.
\]
Its spectrum consists of real, discrete eigenvalues with finite multiplicity. The spectral theorem applies to \( L_{\sym} \), enabling functional calculus and semigroup generation. In particular, the Fredholm determinant
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_{\sym})
\]
is well-defined, and its analytic structure supports the spectral determinant identity proven in Chapter~\ref{sec:determinant_identity}.
\end{proof}
