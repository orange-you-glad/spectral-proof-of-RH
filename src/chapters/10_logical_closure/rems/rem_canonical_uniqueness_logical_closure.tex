\begin{remark}[Canonical Uniqueness Reinforces Equivalence]
\label{rem:canonical_uniqueness_logical_closure}
The equivalence \(\RH \iff \Spec(\Lsym) \subset \mathbb{R}\) established in \thmref{thm:rh_spectrum_equiv} is not merely existential but structurally rigid. As shown in \propref{prop:inverse_spectral_rigidity} and \corref{cor:canonical_operator_uniqueness}, the operator \( \Lsym \) is uniquely determined (up to unitary equivalence) by its determinant identity. This ensures that no alternative trace-class realization of \( \Xi(s) \) can evade the spectral consequences of the Riemann Hypothesis. Thus, the logical closure of RH via \( \Lsym \) is canonical, analytic, and exclusive.
