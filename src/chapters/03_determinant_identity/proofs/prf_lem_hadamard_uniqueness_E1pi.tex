\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{lem:hadamard_uniqueness_E1pi}]
Let \( f, g \in \mathcal{E}_1^\pi \) be entire functions of order one and exponential type exactly \( \pi \), with identical zero sets \( \{ \lambda_n \} \subset \C \), counted with multiplicity. Suppose \( f(0) = g(0) \).

\medskip

By Hadamardâ€™s factorization theorem for genus one~\cite[Ch.~1, Thm.~11]{Levin1996EntireLectures}, both \( f \) and \( g \) admit canonical representations:
\[
f(\lambda) = f(0) \prod_n \left( 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_n} \right) \exp\left( \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_n} \right), \qquad
g(\lambda) = g(0) \prod_n \left( 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_n} \right) \exp\left( \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_n} \right).
\]

Since \( f(0) = g(0) \), the prefactors agree. Hence \( f(\lambda) = g(\lambda) \) identically on \( \C \). This proves the uniqueness of the entire function from its zeros and normalization in the class \( \mathcal{E}_1^\pi \).
\end{proof}
