\begin{definition}[Fredholm Determinant]
\label{def:fredholm_determinant}
Let \( H \) be a separable complex Hilbert space, and let \( T \in \TC(H) \) be a trace-class operator.

The \emph{Fredholm determinant} of the bounded operator \( I + T \colon H \to H \) is defined by the absolutely convergent infinite product:
\[
\det(I + T) := \prod_{n=1}^\infty (1 + \lambda_n),
\]
where \( \{ \lambda_n \} \subset \C \) are the eigenvalues of \( T \), counted with algebraic multiplicity. Convergence follows from the trace-class condition:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty |\lambda_n| < \infty.
\]
This definition is independent of the choice of orthonormal basis.

\medskip

The function \( \lambda \mapsto \det(I + \lambda T) \) defines an entire function on \( \C \), analytic in \( \lambda \), and satisfies the logarithmic derivative identity:
\[
\frac{d}{d\lambda} \log \det(I + \lambda T)
= \Tr\left[ (I + \lambda T)^{-1} T \right],
\]
valid on the open set where \( I + \lambda T \) is invertible.

\medskip

If \( T \) is self-adjoint, then each \( \lambda_n \in \R \), and the determinant is real-analytic for real \( \lambda \) away from the singularities \( \lambda = -1/\lambda_n \). The Fredholm determinant is meromorphic with simple zeros at \( \lambda = -1/\lambda_n \).

\medskip

In special cases—such as for certain elliptic differential operators—the Fredholm determinant coincides with the Carleman \(\zeta\)-regularized determinant, although the constructions are analytically distinct in general.
