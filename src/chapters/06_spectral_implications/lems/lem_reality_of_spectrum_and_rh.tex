\begin{lemma}[Reality of Spectrum Equivalent to \(\RH\)]
\label{lem_reality_of_spectrum_and_rh}

Let \( L_{\sym} \in \TC(\HPsi) \) be the canonical self-adjoint trace-class operator constructed from the completed Riemann zeta function \( \XiR(s) \). Let \( \rho = \tfrac{1}{2} + i\gamma \) be a nontrivial zero of \( \zetaR(s) \), and define its associated spectral image:
\[
\mu_\rho := \frac{1}{i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2})} = \frac{1}{\gamma}.
\]

Then:
\[
\mu_\rho \in \R \iff \Re(\rho) = \tfrac{1}{2}.
\]

\medskip

\noindent
Consequently, the Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to the spectral reality of the canonical operator:
\[
\Spec(L_{\sym}) \subset \R \iff \RH.
\]
\end{lemma}
