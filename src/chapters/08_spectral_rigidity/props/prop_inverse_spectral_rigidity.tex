\begin{proposition}[Inverse Spectral Rigidity]
\label{prop:inverse_spectral_rigidity}

Let \( L_1, L_2 \in \TC(\HPsi) \) be compact, self-adjoint operators on the exponentially weighted Hilbert space
\[
\HPsi := L^2(\R, e^{\alpha |x|} dx), \qquad \alpha > \pi.
\]
Suppose:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The spectra of \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) agree as multisets, including algebraic multiplicities:
  \[
  \Spec(L_1) = \Spec(L_2).
  \]

  \item Their Carleman \(\zeta\)-regularized determinants agree globally:
  \[
  \det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_1) = \det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_2), \qquad \forall\, \lambda \in \C.
  \]
\end{itemize}

Then \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) are unitarily equivalent: there exists a unitary operator \( U \colon \HPsi \to \HPsi \) such that
\[
L_2 = U L_1 U^{-1}.
\]

\medskip

\noindent
In particular, if both operators arise from the canonical convolution construction associated with the completed zeta function \( \XiR(s) \), then
\[
L_1 = L_2.
\]
\end{proposition}
