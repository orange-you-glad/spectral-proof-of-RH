\begin{remark}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:spectral-zero-bijection-revised}, the map
\[
\rho \mapsto \mu_\rho := \frac{1}{i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2})}
\]
defines a canonical, multiplicity-preserving bijection between the nontrivial zeros of \( \zeta(s) \) and the nonzero spectrum of \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \).
This inverse spectral map is uniquely determined by the vanishing structure of the determinant:
\[
\det\nolimits_{\zeta}(I - \lambda L_{\mathrm{sym}}) = \frac{\Xi(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda)}{\Xi(\tfrac{1}{2})},
\]
whose zeros correspond precisely to the values \( \lambda = i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \), with multiplicity preserved by Hadamard factorization.
\end{remark}

% === RH is equivalent to spectral reality of L_sym via determinant identity and bijection ===

\begin{remark}
By Hadamard factorization, the multiplicity of a nontrivial zero \( \rho \) of \( \zeta(s) \) matches the order of vanishing of the canonical determinant at \( \lambda = i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \). Hence, if \( \zeta(s) \) had a multiple zero, the spectrum of \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \) would reflect this via a repeated eigenvalue.
This preserves full compatibility between the eigenvalue multiplicity and the analytic genus of \( \Xi(s) \).
\end{remark}

% === Self-adjointness of L_sym ⇒ spectrum ⊆ ℝ ⇒ RH holds unconditionally ===

% --- Corollary: Full spectral determination of the zeta zeros ---
\input{chapters/09_logical_closure/cors/cor_spectral_determines_zeta}
\input{chapters/09_logical_closure/proofs/prf_cor_spectral_determines_zeta}

\begin{remark}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:trace_distribution_positivity}, the spectral trace distribution
\[
\phi \mapsto \operatorname{Tr}(\phi(L_{\mathrm{sym}}))
\]
defines a positive tempered distribution on \( \mathbb{R} \). This confirms that the
functional calculus applied to \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \) is positivity-preserving for all
non-negative test functions \( \phi \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}) \), and ensures
analytic and spectral compatibility for zeta-regularized dynamics.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Final Deductive Closure]
The analytic structure of \( \Xi(s) \) canonically determines the operator \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \). Its spectral data, via determinant and trace asymptotics, canonically determine the zero set of \( \Xi(s) \). The self-adjointness of \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \) implies real spectrum, which under the spectral bijection is logically equivalent to RH. Therefore:
\[
\operatorname{Spec}(L_{\mathrm{sym}}) \subset \mathbb{R}
\quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad
\rho = \tfrac{1}{2} + i\gamma \text{ for all } \zeta(\rho) = 0,
\]
and thus the Riemann Hypothesis holds.
\end{remark}
