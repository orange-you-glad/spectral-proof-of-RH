\begin{lemma}[Short-Time Upper Bound for the Heat Trace]
\label{lem:hk_upper_bound}
Let \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \in \mathcal{C}_1(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \) be the canonical compact, self-adjoint operator with spectrum \( \{ \mu_n \} \subset \mathbb{R} \), and let \( \{ e_n \} \subset H_{\Psi_\alpha} \) be an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors.

Then there exists a constant \( c_2 > 0 \) such that for all \( 0 < t \le 1 \),
\[
\operatorname{Tr}\left( e^{-t L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2} \right) \le c_2\, t^{-1/2}.
\]

\medskip
\noindent
This inequality holds uniformly on compact subintervals of \( (0,1] \), and reflects the spectral scaling of dimension one. The trace-class and analytic regularity of the semigroup \( e^{-t L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2} \) are guaranteed by \lemref{lem:heat_semigroup_wellposed}, and the spectral decay estimate \( \mu_n \sim \frac{1}{\gamma_n} \) from \lemref{lem:spectral_decay_bounds} ensures convergence of the trace series and consistency with the \( t^{-1/2} \) envelope.
\end{lemma}
