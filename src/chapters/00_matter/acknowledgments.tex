\section*{Acknowledgments}

The author gratefully acknowledges the foundational analytic frameworks in spectral theory, operator ideals, and analytic number theory that structure this work.

In particular, the author is indebted to B. Ya. Levin for the theory of entire functions, Barry Simon and Michael Reed for the architecture of trace ideals and self-adjoint operators, and to E. C. Titchmarsh and H. M. Edwards for their expositions on the Riemann zeta function.

The analytic perspective on zeta-function zeros as a spectral object owes special inspiration to Peter Sarnak, whose work on the arithmetic and spectral theory of automorphic forms has clarified the bridge between number theory, geometry, and quantum mechanics.

The construction of the canonical spectral operator \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \), the analysis of its heat trace asymptotics, and the realization of \( \Xi(s) \) as a zeta-regularized determinant all rest on these tools.

The analytic structure of this manuscript inherits both the rigor and style of these frameworks, and aims to reflect their modular clarity and conceptual depth.
