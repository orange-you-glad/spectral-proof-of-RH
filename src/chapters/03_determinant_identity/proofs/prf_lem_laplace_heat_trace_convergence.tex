\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{lem:laplace_heat_trace_convergence}]
Let \( L_{\sym} \in \TC(\HPsi) \) be the canonical operator as constructed in \cref{sec:operator_construction}. For all \( t > 0 \), the operator \( e^{-t L_{\sym}^2} \) lies in \( \TC(\HPsi) \) by the spectral theorem and the closure of the trace-class ideal under holomorphic functional calculus. In particular, the trace function
\[
t \mapsto \Tr(e^{-t L_{\sym}^2})
\]
is smooth and strictly positive for \( t > 0 \), and the semigroup \( \{ e^{-t L_{\sym}^2} \}_{t > 0} \) is strongly continuous and holomorphic in \( t \).

\smallskip
\noindent
From the short-time asymptotics in \cref{sec:heat_kernel_asymptotics}, we have
\[
\Tr(e^{-t L_{\sym}^2}) \lesssim t^{-1/2} \quad \text{as } t \to 0^+,
\]
with constants uniform on compact subsets. Additionally, the spectral smoothing of \( L_{\sym}^2 \) implies exponential decay:
\[
\Tr(e^{-t L_{\sym}^2}) \lesssim e^{-ct} \quad \text{as } t \to \infty,
\]
for some \( c > 0 \).

\smallskip
\noindent
The Laplace transform defining the Carleman determinant thus reads
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_{\sym}) = \exp\left( - \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-\lambda^2 t}}{t} \Tr(e^{-t L_{\sym}^2}) \, dt \right),
\]
and converges absolutely for all \( \lambda \in \C \), by comparison with
\[
\int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-\lambda^2 t}}{t^{3/2}} \, dt < \infty,
\]
using the short-time trace bound.

\smallskip
\noindent
Finally, since the Laplace transform of the trace-class heat semigroup defines an entire function of order one, and the exponential type is determined by the Paley--Wiener bounds on the spectral kernel, we conclude from \cref{lem:det_identity_entire_order_one} that the determinant has exact exponential type \( \pi \), completing the proof.
\end{proof}
