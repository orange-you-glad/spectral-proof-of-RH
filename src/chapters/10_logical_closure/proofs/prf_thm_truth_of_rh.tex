\begin{proof}[Proof of \thmref{thm:truth_of_rh}]
Let \( \Lsym \in \TC(\HPsi) \) denote the canonical compact, self-adjoint operator constructed via trace-norm limits of mollified convolution operators derived from the inverse Fourier transform of the completed zeta function \( \Xi(s) \), as detailed in \secref{sec:operator_construction}.

\paragraph{Step 1: Spectral Determinant Identity.}
By \thmref{thm:det_identity_revised}, the zeta-regularized Fredholm determinant of \( \Lsym \) satisfies:
\[
\detz(I - \lambda \Lsym) = \frac{\Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right)}{\Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} \right)}, \qquad \forall \lambda \in \C.
\]
This identity is proven unconditionally using trace-class convergence and heat kernel asymptotics, and its zero set encodes the nontrivial zeros of \( \zeta(s) \).

\paragraph{Step 2: Canonical Spectral Encoding.}
By \thmref{thm:spectral_zero_bijection_revised}, each nontrivial zero \( \rho \in \C \) corresponds to a unique nonzero eigenvalue
\[
\mu_\rho := \frac{1}{i}(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \in \Spec(\Lsym),
\]
with multiplicities preserved. This correspondence is analytic and established independently of any assumption about the realness of \( \mu_\rho \).

\paragraph{Step 3: Spectral Reality.}
From the analytic construction of \( \Lsym \) and the convergence of mollified kernels (see Chapter~\ref{sec:heat_kernel_asymptotics}), we have that \( \Lsym \) is self-adjoint. The spectral theorem for compact, self-adjoint operators implies:
\[
\Spec(\Lsym) \subset \R.
\]

\paragraph{Step 4: Deduction of RH.}
Since each \( \mu_\rho \in \R \), we compute:
\[
\mu_\rho = \frac{1}{i}(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \in \R \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \rho - \tfrac{1}{2} \in i\R \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \Re(\rho) = \tfrac{1}{2}.
\]
Hence, every nontrivial zero of \( \zeta(s) \) lies on the critical line.

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
The operator \( \Lsym \) analytically encodes the full multiset of nontrivial zeta zeros, and its spectrum is real by construction. Therefore,
\[
\zeta(\rho) = 0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \Re(\rho) = \tfrac{1}{2},
\]
and the Riemann Hypothesis follows.
\end{proof}
