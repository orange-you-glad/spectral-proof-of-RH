\begin{lemma}[Canonical Closure of the Spectral Model]
\label{lem:canonical_closure}

Let \( L \in \TC(\HPsi) \cap \KC(\HPsi) \) be a compact, self-adjoint, trace-class operator on the exponentially weighted Hilbert space
\[
\HPsi := L^2(\R, e^{\alpha |x|} \, dx), \qquad \alpha > \pi,
\]
and suppose \( L \) satisfies the normalized spectral determinant identity:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L) = \frac{\XiR\left(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda\right)}{\XiR\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)}, \qquad \forall \lambda \in \C,
\]
with normalization \( \det\nolimits_\zeta(I) = 1 \), and where \( \XiR(s) \) is the completed Riemann zeta function.

\medskip
\noindent
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The nonzero spectrum of \( L \) coincides with that of the canonical operator \( L_{\sym} \), as multisets with algebraic multiplicities:
  \[
  \Spec(L) \setminus \{0\} = \Spec(L_{\sym}) \setminus \{0\};
  \]
  
  \item \( L \) is unitarily equivalent to \( L_{\sym} \): there exists a unitary operator \( U \colon \HPsi \to \HPsi \) such that
  \[
  L = U L_{\sym} U^{-1};
  \]
  
  \item \( L_{\sym} \) is the unique (up to unitary equivalence) compact, self-adjoint trace-class operator whose zeta-regularized determinant realizes the spectral identity associated with \( \XiR(s) \);
  
  \item If \( \widetilde{L} \in \TC \) satisfies the same determinant identity but is not self-adjoint, then \( \widetilde{L} \) is similar to \( L_{\sym} \) in the algebraic sense: there exists an invertible operator \( S \in \mathcal{B}(\HPsi) \) such that
  \[
  \widetilde{L} = S L_{\sym} S^{-1},
  \]
  preserving the nonzero spectrum and multiplicities, though not necessarily realized via a unitary conjugation.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
\noindent
Hence, the canonical spectral determinant associated with \( \XiR(s) \), under trace-class and self-adjointness, uniquely determines the operator \( L_{\sym} \) up to unitary equivalence, and rigidly constrains all other determinant-realizing models to algebraic similarity. This completes the canonical closure of the spectral model.
