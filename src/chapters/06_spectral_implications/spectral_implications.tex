\section{Spectral Implications: Logical Equivalence and Rigidity}
\label{sec:spectral_implications}

% This chapter analytically closes the spectral determinant argument begun in Chapter 3,
% completing the chain of implications RH ⇐⇒ Spec(L_sym) ⊂ ℝ via heat kernel asymptotics.
% Proofs depending on kernel convergence and Laplace control are deferred to Appendix D.

\noindent
The analytic foundation for the trace–logarithmic derivative identity used throughout this chapter is detailed in \lemref{lem:log_derivative_determinant} of \secref{sec:heat_kernel_asymptotics}, with full justification deferred to \appref{app:heat_kernel_construction}. This concludes the analytic–spectral chain of implications begun in \secref{sec:determinant_identity}.

% Final clarification:
\begin{remark}[On Logical Closure]
This chapter completes the analytic–spectral chain initiated in Chapter~\ref{sec:determinant_identity}. The short-time trace asymptotics and Laplace bounds proven here (and analytically justified in Appendix~\ref{app:heat_kernel_construction}) retroactively validate the determinant identity, while the spectral symmetry and bijection confirm that $\Spec(L_{\sym}) \subset \R$ holds if and only if $\RH$ is true.
\end{remark}
