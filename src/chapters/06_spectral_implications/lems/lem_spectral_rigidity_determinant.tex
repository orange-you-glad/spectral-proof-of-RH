\begin{lemma}[Spectral Rigidity from Determinant Identity]
\label{lem:spectral_rigidity_determinant}

Let \( L_1, L_2 \in \TC(\HPsi) \cap \KC(\HPsi) \) be compact, self-adjoint, trace-class operators on the exponentially weighted Hilbert space \( \HPsi := L^2(\R, e^{\alpha|x|}dx) \) with \( \alpha > \pi \).

Suppose their Carlemanâ€“\(\zeta\)-regularized Fredholm determinants coincide:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_1) = \det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_2),
\quad \forall \lambda \in \C,
\]
with both normalized at the origin:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I) = 1.
\]

Then \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) have identical nonzero spectra, including algebraic multiplicities:
\[
\Spec(L_1) \setminus \{0\} = \Spec(L_2) \setminus \{0\}
\quad \text{as multisets}.
\]

If both operators act on the same Hilbert space, then the spectral theorem implies they are unitarily equivalent.
