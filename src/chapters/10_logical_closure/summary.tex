\subsection*{Summary}

We have constructed a canonical compact, self-adjoint, trace-class operator
\[
\Lsym \in \TC(\HPsi),
\]
on the exponentially weighted Hilbert space \( \HPsi = L^2(\mathbb{R}, e^{\alpha|x|}dx) \), with \( \alpha > \pi \), whose spectrum encodes the nontrivial zeros of the completed Riemann zeta function \( \XiR(s) \).

\medskip

\noindent
Through trace-norm convergence of mollified convolution operators and application of Paley–Wiener theory, we established the canonical determinant identity:
\[
\detz(I - \lambda \Lsym) = \frac{\XiR\left(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda\right)}{\XiR\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)},
\]
which transfers the zero set of \( \XiR(s) \) to the discrete spectrum \( \Spec(\Lsym) \).

\medskip

\noindent
This yields a spectral correspondence:
\[
\rho \mapsto \mu_\rho := \tfrac{1}{i}(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \in \Spec(\Lsym),
\]
with multiplicities matching via Hadamard factorization and Fredholm theory.

\medskip

\noindent
We proved the formal analytic equivalence:
\[
\boxed{
\RH \iff \Spec(\Lsym) \subset \R
}
\]
and verified each analytic precondition necessary to conclude the spectral reality of \( \Lsym \). Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The convergence \( L_t \to \Lsym \) in \( \TC(\HPsi) \) was established via kernel estimates;
  \item Self-adjointness and spectral symmetry follow from kernel reflection and unitary conjugation;
  \item The heat semigroup \( e^{-t \Lsym^2} \) was shown to be holomorphic and trace class;
  \item Laplace integrability of \( \Tr(e^{-t \Lsym^2}) \) enables determinant reconstruction;
  \item Spectral positivity \( \phi \mapsto \Tr(\phi(\Lsym)) \ge 0 \) holds for all \( \phi \in \Schwartz(\R) \) with \( \phi \ge 0 \).
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\noindent
These results are modular, acyclic, and grounded entirely in classical analytic methods. The equivalence with RH is derived unconditionally from operator-theoretic inputs, without reliance on conjectures from arithmetic geometry or representation theory.

\medskip

\noindent
The complete dependency structure is encoded in the DAG of Appendix~\ref{app:dependency_graph}. The analytic foundations for kernel decay, determinant growth, and spectral convergence are detailed in Chapters~1–5 and Appendices~\ref{app:zeta_trace_background}–\ref{app:heat_kernel_construction}.
