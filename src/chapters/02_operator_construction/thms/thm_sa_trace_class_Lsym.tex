\begin{theorem}[Self-Adjointness and Trace-Class Structure of \( \Lsym \)]
\label{thm:sa_trace_class_Lsym}
Let \( \Lsym \) be the canonical convolution operator defined as the trace-norm limit of the mollified operators \( L_t \), acting on the exponentially weighted Hilbert space
\[
H_{\Psi_\alpha} := L^2(\R, \Psi_\alpha(x)\, dx), \qquad \Psi_\alpha(x) := e^{\alpha |x|}, \quad \alpha > \pi.
\]

Then:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[\textnormal{(i)}] \( \Lsym \in \TC(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \); that is, it is trace class and realized as
  \[
  \Lsym = \lim_{t \to 0^+} L_t \quad \text{in } \TC(H_{\Psi_\alpha}).
  \]

  \item[\textnormal{(ii)}] \( \Lsym \in \KC(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \); that is, it is compact, since every trace-class operator is compact.

  \item[\textnormal{(iii)}] \( \Lsym \) is self-adjoint:
  \[
  \Lsym = \Lsym^*,
  \]
  with domain closure obtained from the symmetric core \( \Schwartz \subset H_{\Psi_\alpha} \), as established in \lemref{lem:core_essential_sa}.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip

\noindent
This spectral classification guarantees:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The spectrum \( \Spec(\Lsym) \subset \R \) is discrete, consisting of real eigenvalues of finite multiplicity accumulating only at zero.
  \item The spectral theorem applies to \( \Lsym \), enabling functional calculus and definition of the semigroup \( e^{-t\Lsym^2} \).
  \item The Fredholm determinant identity derived in Chapter~\ref{sec:determinant_identity} is rigorously valid and encodes the nontrivial zeros of the completed Riemann zeta function \( \Xi(s) \).
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
