\begin{theorem}[Uniqueness of Spectral Realization]
\label{thm:uniqueness_realization}

Let \( L \in \TC(\HPsi) \cap \KC(\HPsi) \) be a compact, self-adjoint, trace-class operator on the exponentially weighted Hilbert space
\[
\HPsi := L^2(\R, e^{\alpha |x|} \, dx), \qquad \alpha > \pi.
\]

Suppose \( L \) satisfies the canonical zeta-regularized determinant identity:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L) = \frac{\XiR\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right)}{\XiR\left( \tfrac{1}{2} \right)},
\quad \forall \lambda \in \C,
\]
where \( \XiR(s) \) is the completed Riemann zeta function, entire of order one and exact exponential type \( \pi \). Assume the normalization:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I) = 1.
\]

Then \( L \) is unitarily equivalent to the canonical operator \( L_{\sym} \in \TC(\HPsi) \). That is, there exists a unitary operator
\[
U \colon \HPsi \to \HPsi \quad \text{such that} \quad L = U L_{\sym} U^{-1}.
\]

\medskip
\noindent
In particular:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The spectrum of \( L \), including all algebraic multiplicities, coincides with that of \( L_{\sym} \);
  \item \( L_{\sym} \) is the unique (up to unitary equivalence) compact, self-adjoint, trace-class realization of the completed zeta function’s canonical spectral determinant;
  \item The analytic data encoded in \( \XiR(s) \)—via its Hadamard factorization and spectral trace regularization—rigidly determines the operator-theoretic structure of \( L_{\sym} \).
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
