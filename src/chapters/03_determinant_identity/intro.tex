\subsection*{Introduction}

This section establishes the canonical analytic identity:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_{\mathrm{sym}})
= \frac{\Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right)}{\Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} \right)},
\]
realizing the completed Riemann zeta function \( \Xi(s) \) as the Carleman \(\zeta\)-regularized Fredholm determinant of the canonical compact, self-adjoint operator \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \in \mathcal{C}_1(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \), constructed in Section~\ref{sec:operator-construction}.

\medskip
\noindent
The proof proceeds via a modular analytic program:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We construct the Fredholm determinant via Carleman \(\zeta\)-regularization applied to the Laplace-transformed heat trace of \( L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2 \). Convergence in the Schatten ideal \( \mathcal{S}_1 \) ensures the trace series is entire in \( \lambda \), and the kernel estimates from Chapter~\ref{sec:heat-kernel-asymptotics} provide sharp growth control;

  \item The singular short-time behavior of the heat trace,
  \[
  \operatorname{Tr}(e^{-tL^2_{\mathrm{sym}}}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi t}} \log\left(\frac{1}{t}\right) + \mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2}),
  \]
  derived in Lemma~\ref{lem:heat-trace-expansion}, determines the exponential type and genus of the determinant. Laplace–Mellin theory implies that the resulting entire function is of order one and exact exponential type \( \pi \), consistent with the Hadamard structure of \( \Xi(s) \);

  \item We apply Hadamard’s uniqueness theorem for entire functions of genus one and exponential type \( \pi \), identifying the determinant with
  \[
  \frac{\Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right)}{\Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} \right)}
  \]
  by comparing logarithmic derivatives on \( \mathbb{C} \setminus \operatorname{Spec}(L_{\mathrm{sym}}) \);

  \item We remove the exponential prefactor ambiguity by proving \( \operatorname{Tr}(L_{\mathrm{sym}}) = 0 \) (see Lemma~\ref{lem:trace-zero}), thereby canonically normalizing the determinant to satisfy
  \[
  \det\nolimits_\zeta(I) = 1.
  \]
\end{itemize}

\noindent
This analytic phase is logically self-contained and acyclic: the determinant identity is derived entirely from operator-theoretic and trace-class estimates, without invoking any spectral correspondence between the eigenvalues of \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \) and the nontrivial zeros of \( \zeta(s) \). That correspondence is established independently in Section~\ref{sec:spectral-correspondence}, following the identity proven here.
