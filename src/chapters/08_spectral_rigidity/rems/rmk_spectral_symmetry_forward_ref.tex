\begin{remark}[Forward Reference: Spectral Symmetry]
\label{rmk:spectral_symmetry_forward_ref}
The symmetry of the spectrum of the canonical operator \( L_{\sym} \in \mathcal{C}_1(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \),
namely that
\[
\mu \in \Spec(L_{\sym}) \quad \Longrightarrow \quad -\mu \in \Spec(L_{\sym}),
\]
is established earlier in \lemref{lem:spectral_symmetry} (Chapter~4). This result is a direct consequence of the
evenness and reality of the kernel derived from the completed zeta functionâ€™s Fourier transform, together
with unitary equivalence to a symmetric convolution operator on \( L^2(\mathbb{R}) \).
