\section{Spectral Physics Interpretation}
\label{app:spectral_physics_link}

\noindent\textbf{[Noncritical Appendix]}  
This appendix explores speculative physical analogies of the canonical operator \( \Lsym \in \TC(\HPsi) \). No physical model is constructed or required for any analytic result. However, the spectral structure of \( \Lsym \) formally resembles certain Hamiltonians and partition operators in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. These parallels offer a suggestive bridge between analytic number theory and spectral dynamics.

\subsection*{Partition Function Analogy}

The spectral trace
\[
Z(t) := \Tr(e^{-t \Lsym})
\]
resembles a thermal partition function for a quantum system with discrete energy levels \( \mu_n \). Its short-time singular expansion,
\[
Z(t) \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi t}} \log\left( \frac{1}{t} \right) + o(t^{-1/2}), \qquad t \to 0^+,
\]
mirrors ultraviolet divergences common in heat kernel regularization of noncompact or scale-invariant systems.

The zeta-regularized Fredholm determinant
\[
\detz(I - \lambda \Lsym)
\]
may then be interpreted as a spectral free energy, with its logarithm acting as a generating function or thermodynamic potential. This analogy is made rigorous within analytic number theory via \cref{thm:det_identity_revised}.

\subsection*{GUE Statistics and Inverse Spectrum}

Under the nonlinear map
\[
\gamma_n \longmapsto \mu_n := \frac{1}{\gamma_n},
\]
the conjectured GUE distribution of zeta zero ordinates~\cite{Montgomery1973PairCorrelation, Berry1986RiemannSpectra} becomes a compressed spectrum with enhanced infrared regularity. In this formulation:

\begin{itemize}
  \item High-energy behavior is compressed and made trace-class;
  \item Low-frequency structure becomes spectrally accessible;
  \item The spectrum admits heat kernel regularization and Mellin analytic continuation;
  \item \( \Lsym \) behaves formally as an arithmetic Hamiltonian with bounded energy and regulated entropy.
\end{itemize}

This mapping is not a model of quantum chaos—but it reflects how number-theoretic randomness is smoothed into traceable spectral behavior via analytic inversion.

\subsection*{Interpretation and Outlook}

These analogies have no bearing on the analytic construction or equivalence theorems. No path integral, quantization procedure, or dynamical system is proposed. However, the structural parallels are suggestive, and may motivate future exploration in:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Arithmetic quantum field theory and trace-class spectral Hamiltonians;
  \item Zeta regularization as a bridge between arithmetic and thermodynamic entropy;
  \item Spectral categorification of zeta zeros via quantum symmetries or gauge dualities;
  \item Diagrammatic encodings of number-theoretic identities using spectral partition algebras.
\end{itemize}

These directions remain speculative. But the canonical operator \( \Lsym \), and the trace-asymptotic construction of \( \tilde{L}_{\mathrm{sym}} \), establish a stable analytic ground from which dynamic or physical interpretations might one day rise.
