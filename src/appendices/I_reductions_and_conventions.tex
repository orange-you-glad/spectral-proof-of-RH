\section{Reductions and Conventions}
\label{app:reductions_and_conventions}

This appendix records global analytic conventions and structural assumptions used throughout the manuscript. These ensure convergence, compactness, and spectral closure across all operator-theoretic constructions. No result in the core chapters depends on unstated analytic input.

\subsection*{Hilbert Space Framework}

All Hilbert spaces \( H \) are complex, separable, and equipped with the standard inner product. All operators \( T \colon H \to H \) are assumed linear and bounded unless otherwise stated.

Operator convergence statements (e.g., \( L_t \to \Lsym \)) are understood in the trace norm \( \|\cdot\|_{\TC} \), unless otherwise specified. Self-adjointness and Schatten class inclusions are justified via kernel decay and Fourier-analytic estimates, as in~\cite{Simon2005TraceIdeals, ReedSimon1980I}.

\subsection*{Fourier Transform Convention}

We use the unitary Fourier transform on \( L^2(\R) \):
\[
\FT f(\lambda) := \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{\R} f(x)\, e^{-i\lambda x}\, dx,
\]
with:
\[
\FT^{-1} = \FT, \qquad \FT^2 f(x) = f(-x).
\]

Convolution operators diagonalize under \( \FT \), and even real-valued convolution profiles yield self-adjoint operators on \( L^2 \).

\subsection*{Spectral Domain}

Spectral variables \( \lambda \in \R \) are centered via \( s = \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \), aligning the critical line with the real axis. This normalization is used throughout to formulate the determinant identity using real spectral data.

No global fields, adèles, or automorphic representations are assumed in Chapters~\ref{sec:foundations}–\ref{sec:logical_closure}. All results are derived from classical real and complex analysis. Functorial extensions to automorphic \( L \)-functions are proposed in \appref{app:functorial_extensions}.

\subsection*{Weight Function Normalization}

The fixed exponential weight is:
\[
\Psi_\alpha(x) := e^{\alpha |x|}, \qquad \alpha > \pi.
\]
This ensures:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Integrability of \( \FT^{-1}[\Xi(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda)] \);
  \item Trace-class convergence of \( L_t \to \Lsym \);
  \item Validity of short-time heat kernel expansions and Laplace integrability.
\end{itemize}

Alternative weights, such as \( |\Xi(\tfrac{1}{2} + ix)|^2 \), are not used due to insufficient decay for compact operator theory.

\subsection*{Spectral Parameterization}

The centered spectral profile is defined by:
\[
\phi(\lambda) := \Xi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right), \qquad \lambda \in \R.
\]
This choice guarantees:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Even symmetry: \( \phi(-\lambda) = \phi(\lambda) \);
  \item Self-adjoint convolution operators with kernel \( \FT^{-1}[\phi] \);
  \item Spectral encoding: \( \rho = \tfrac{1}{2} + i\gamma \mapsto \mu_\rho := \tfrac{1}{i}(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) = \gamma^{-1} \);
  \item Canonical realization of \( \Xi(s) \) as a zeta-regularized Fredholm determinant.
\end{itemize}
