\begin{proof}[Proof of \corref{cor:spectral_determines_zeta}]
From \lemref{lem:spectral_zero_encoding}, there exists a multiplicity-preserving bijection between the nontrivial zeros \( \rho \in \C \) of \( \zetaR(s) \) and the nonzero spectrum of the canonical operator \( L_{\sym} \), given by:
\[
\mu_\rho := \frac{1}{i(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2})}, \qquad
\rho = \tfrac{1}{2} + i \mu_\rho^{-1}.
\]

This correspondence preserves multiplicities due to the Hadamard factorization structure of the determinant:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_{\sym}) = \frac{\XiR\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda \right)}{\XiR\left( \tfrac{1}{2} \right)},
\]
whose zeros fully determine \( \XiR(s) \) and thus encode all nontrivial zeta zeros with their correct orders.

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
The map \( \mu \mapsto \rho := \tfrac{1}{2} + i \mu^{-1} \) defines a canonical bijection from \( \Spec(L_{\sym}) \setminus \{0\} \) to the nontrivial zero set of \( \zetaR(s) \), with multiplicities preserved. Therefore, the spectrum of \( L_{\sym} \) determines the zeros completely.
\end{proof}
