\begin{remark}[Proof Architecture and Logical Closure]
\label{rem:dag_acyclic_proof_flow}

All results in this chapter follow from analytically justified constructions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The canonical operator \( L_{\sym} \in \TC(\HPsi) \), built via mollified convolution (\cref{sec:operator_construction});
  \item The spectral determinant identity and Hadamard factorization (\cref{sec:determinant_identity});
  \item The bijective spectral encoding of zeta zeros (\cref{sec:spectral_correspondence});
  \item The trace-class heat kernel and semigroup convergence (\cref{sec:heat_kernel_asymptotics});
  \item The equivalence \( \RH \iff \Spec(L_{\sym}) \subset \R \), established in \cref{sec:spectral_implications} and closed here.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\noindent
At no point is the Riemann Hypothesis assumed. The spectral bijection is proven independently, the determinant identity is derived from trace-class kernel analysis, and the final implication \( \Spec(L_{\sym}) \subset \R \Rightarrow \RH \) follows purely from spectral encoding and self-adjointness.

\medskip

\noindent
This completes the acyclic modular proof architecture documented in \appref{app:dependency_graph}, and resolves RH as a spectral equivalence:
\[
\boxed{
\RH \iff \Spec(L_{\sym}) \subset \R
}
\]
