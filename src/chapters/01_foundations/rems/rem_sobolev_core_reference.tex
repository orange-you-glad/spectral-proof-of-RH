\begin{remark}[Core Density and Sobolev Completion]
\label{rem:sobolev_core_reference}
The density of \( \Schwartz(\R) \subset H_{\Psi_\alpha} \) can also be justified via Sobolev spaces adapted to exponential weights.

\medskip

Let \( H^s_\alpha(\R) \) denote the weighted Sobolev space defined by
\[
H^s_\alpha(\R) := \left\{ f \in L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}(\R) \,\middle|\, \langle D \rangle^s f \in L^2(\R, \Psi_\alpha(x)\, dx) \right\}, \quad \Psi_\alpha(x) := e^{\alpha |x|}, \quad \alpha > 0.
\]
Then the embeddings
\[
\Schwartz(\R) \hookrightarrow H^s_\alpha(\R) \hookrightarrow H_{\Psi_\alpha}
\]
are continuous and dense for all \( s \ge 0 \), and can be used to construct a graph-norm core for unbounded convolution operators with exponentially decaying kernels.

\medskip

This functional-analytic perspective complements the analytic vector argument used to establish essential self-adjointness of \( L_{\sym} \) on \( \Schwartz(\R) \) in later chapters. It also justifies stability of mollifier domains and semigroup bounds under Sobolev-scale closure.
