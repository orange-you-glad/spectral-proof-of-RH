\begin{remark}[Non-Removability of the Logarithmic Singularity]
\label{rem:log_singularity_necessary}
The leading-order term
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi t}} \log\left( \frac{1}{t} \right)
\]
in the heat trace expansion is structurally necessary and cannot be eliminated by normalization or subtraction. Its presence is dictated by three independent spectral considerations:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Hadamard Structure.} The completed Riemann zeta function \( \Xi(s) \) has genus one and exponential type \( \pi \). Its Hadamard factorization forces logarithmic growth in the Mellinâ€“Laplace transform of its spectral profile.

  \item \textbf{Counting Law.} The eigenvalue counting function satisfies
  \[
  N(\lambda) \sim C \lambda^{1/2} \log \lambda,
  \]
  as shown in \secref{sec:tauberian_growth}. This log-enhanced Weyl law, under Laplace inversion, mandates a leading singular term of the form \( t^{-1/2} \log(1/t) \).

  \item \textbf{Zeta Compatibility.} The regularized determinant \( \det\nolimits_\zeta(L_{\sym}^2) \) is defined via
  \[
  \log \det\nolimits_\zeta(L_{\sym}^2) = -\int_0^\infty \frac{\Tr(e^{-t L_{\sym}^2}) - P(t)}{t} \, dt.
  \]
  Convergence of this integral requires the parametrix subtraction \( P(t) \) to precisely cancel the \( \log(1/t)/\sqrt{t} \) singularity. If this term were absent, the zeta function \( \zeta_L(s) \) would fail to be analytic at \( s = 0 \), contradicting \lemref{lem:log_derivative_determinant}.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
\noindent
This logarithmic divergence thus serves as a diagnostic of both the analytic class of the kernel and the spectral dimension of \( L_{\sym} \). It bridges trace behavior, eigenvalue asymptotics, and the entire structure of the canonical determinant.
