\begin{lemma}[Canonical Closure of the Spectral Model]
\label{lem:canonical-closure}
Let \( L \in \mathcal{S}_1(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \) be a compact, self-adjoint operator on the exponentially weighted Hilbert space
\[
H_{\Psi_\alpha} := L^2(\mathbb{R}, e^{\alpha |x|} \, dx), \qquad \alpha > \pi,
\]
and suppose that \( L \) satisfies the normalized determinant identity
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L) = \frac{\Xi\left(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda\right)}{\Xi\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)}, \qquad \forall \lambda \in \mathbb{C},
\]
where \( \Xi(s) \) is the completed Riemann zeta function and the determinant satisfies \( \det_\zeta(I) = 1 \).

\medskip
\noindent
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \( L \) and \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \) have identical nonzero spectra (as multisets with algebraic multiplicities);
  \item \( L \) is unitarily equivalent to \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \): there exists a unitary operator \( U : H_{\Psi_\alpha} \to H_{\Psi_\alpha} \) such that
  \[
  L = U L_{\mathrm{sym}} U^{-1};
  \]
  \item \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \) is the unique (up to unitary equivalence) compact, self-adjoint trace-class operator realizing the completed zeta function via its canonical Fredholm determinant;
  \item Any operator \( \widetilde{L} \in \mathcal{S}_1 \) that satisfies the same determinant identity and is not self-adjoint must be similar (in the algebraic sense) to \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \), preserving eigenvalues and multiplicities. In particular, there exists an invertible \( S \in \mathcal{B}(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \) such that
  \[
  \widetilde{L} = S L_{\mathrm{sym}} S^{-1},
  \]
  but not necessarily with \( S \) unitary.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
\noindent
Hence, the spectral determinant of \( \Xi(s) \), together with the trace-class and self-adjoint assumptions, canonically determine the operator \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \) up to unitary equivalence.
\end{lemma}
