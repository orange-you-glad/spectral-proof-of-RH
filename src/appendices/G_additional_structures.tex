\section{Additional Structures and Future Directions}
\label{app:additional_structures}

\noindent\textbf{[Noncritical Appendix]}  
This appendix is logically inert: no theorem, lemma, or proof in the core manuscript depends on this material. It records exploratory extensions of the canonical spectral framework to broader arithmetic and cohomological settings. These ideas are conjectural and serve as conceptual prompts for future development, not as established results.

\subsection*{Spectral Generalizations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Functorial \( L \)-Functions.}  
  For a completed automorphic \( L \)-function \( \Lambda_\pi(s) \), one may conjecturally define a spectral weight
  \[
  \Psi_\pi(x) := \left| \Lambda_\pi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i x \right) \right|^2, \quad
  H_{\Psi_\pi} := L^2(\R, \Psi_\pi(x) dx),
  \]
  and postulate the existence of a compact, self-adjoint, trace-class operator \( L_\pi \in \TC(H_{\Psi_\pi}) \) satisfying
  \[
  \detz(I - \lambda L_\pi) = \frac{\Lambda_\pi(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda)}{\Lambda_\pi(\tfrac{1}{2})}.
  \]
  This generalizes the canonical spectral model for \( \XiR(s) \) (see \cref{sec:determinant_identity}) and is further explored in \appref{app:functorial_extensions}. Under such operators, one would have:
  \[
  \GRH(\pi) \iff \Spec(L_\pi) \subset \R,
  \]
  extending the spectral equivalence of Chapter~\ref{sec:spectral_implications} to the automorphic setting.

  \item \textbf{Cohomological Realization over \( \Spec(\Z) \).}  
  Following the framework proposed by Deninger~\cite{Deninger1998Frobenius}, one anticipates a Frobenius-type operator \( \mathrm{Frob} \) acting on a hypothetical cohomology theory of \( \Spec(\Z) \), satisfying a trace identity:
  \[
  \det\nolimits_{\mathrm{reg}}(I - u \cdot \mathrm{Frob}) = \zeta(u).
  \]
  In this context, \( \Lsym \) may be viewed as a Laplace-type or spectral realization of such a Frobenius action, consistent with the trace formula frameworks of Connes~\cite{Connes1999TraceFormula}.

  \item \textbf{Higher-Rank Langlands Extensions.}  
  For a reductive group \( G \), one may postulate a canonical operator \( L_{\sym,G} \in \TC(H_{\Psi_G}) \) such that:
  \[
  \detz(I - \lambda L_{\sym,G}) = \frac{\Lambda^G(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda)}{\Lambda^G(\tfrac{1}{2})},
  \]
  where \( \Lambda^G(s) \) is the Langlands \( L \)-function for \( G \) or its dual group \( {}^L G \). Potential realizations include trace formulas, geometric Langlands models, and moduli of shtukas.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Outlook}

The canonical determinant identity for \( \XiR(s) \) suggests a spectral framework where global \( L \)-functions admit analytic realization via trace-class operators. If such models can be defined uniformly, they could unify:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Analytic continuation and functional equations via determinant normalization;
  \item Spectral encodings of zero multiplicities via Fredholm factorization;
  \item Functoriality and categorical duality via trace-compatible operators or derived categories.
\end{itemize}

These directions are speculative. They do not participate in the closed proof of the Riemann Hypothesis (\cref{sec:logical_closure}) but offer conceptual guideposts for extending the spectral paradigm across arithmetic geometry and representation theory.
