\begin{lemma}[Essential Self-Adjointness of $L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2$]
\label{lem:Lsym_square_selfadjoint}
Let \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \in \mathcal{C}_1(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \) be the canonical convolution operator constructed from the inverse Fourier transform of \( \Xi(s) \), with \( \alpha > \pi \). Then the squared operator \( L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2 \) is essentially self-adjoint on the dense core \( \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}) \subset H_{\Psi_\alpha} \), and its closure admits a discrete spectral resolution.

That is,
\[
\overline{L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2|_{\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})}} = L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2 = \left( L_{\mathrm{sym}}^2 \right)^*,
\]
with spectrum contained in \( [0, \infty) \), consisting only of real eigenvalues of finite multiplicity, accumulating only at 0.
\end{lemma}
