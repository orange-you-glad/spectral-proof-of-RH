\begin{lemma}[Essential Self-Adjointness of \( L_{\sym}^2 \)]
\label{lem:Lsym_square_selfadjoint}
Let \( L_{\sym} \in \TC(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \) be the canonical convolution operator constructed from the inverse Fourier transform of \( \Xi(s) \), for any \( \alpha > \pi \). Then the squared operator \( L_{\sym}^2 \) is essentially self-adjoint on the dense core \( \Schwartz \subset H_{\Psi_\alpha} \), and its closure admits a discrete spectral resolution.

That is,
\[
\overline{L_{\sym}^2|_{\Schwartz}} = L_{\sym}^2 = \left( L_{\sym}^2 \right)^*,
\]
with spectrum contained in \( [0, \infty) \), consisting solely of real eigenvalues with finite multiplicity, accumulating only at zero.
\end{lemma}
