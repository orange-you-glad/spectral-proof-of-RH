\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:spectral_rigidity_determinant}]
Let \( L_1, L_2 \in \mathcal{S}_1(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \) be compact, self-adjoint trace-class operators such that
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_1) = \det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_2), \quad \forall \lambda \in \mathbb{C},
\]
and assume \( \det\nolimits_\zeta(I) = 1 \) for both.

\paragraph{Step 1: Entire Determinants Encode Spectra.}
For compact, self-adjoint operators in \( \mathcal{S}_1 \), the zeta-regularized Fredholm determinant has the canonical Hadamard product:
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_j) = \prod_{\mu \in \Spec(L_j) \setminus \{0\}} (1 - \lambda \mu)^{\operatorname{mult}_{L_j}(\mu)},
\quad j = 1,2.
\]
Since the two determinant functions coincide as entire functions of order one and exponential type \( \pi \), with identical normalization at \( \lambda = 0 \), it follows that their sets of zeros (with multiplicity) coincide. That is,
\[
\Spec(L_1) \setminus \{0\} = \Spec(L_2) \setminus \{0\}
\quad \text{as multisets}.
\]

\paragraph{Step 2: Spectral Theorem Completion.}
If both \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) act on the same Hilbert space and are self-adjoint with matching spectra and multiplicities, then by the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators, there exists a unitary operator \( U \colon H_{\Psi_\alpha} \to H_{\Psi_\alpha} \) such that
\[
L_2 = U L_1 U^{-1}.
\]

\paragraph{Conclusion.}
The determinant identity, combined with trace-class structure and normalization, rigidly determines the operator spectrum up to unitary equivalence. This completes the proof.
