\begin{corollary}[Spectral Reconstruction of the Completed Zeta Function]
\label{cor:spectrum_determines_zeta}
Let \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \in \mathcal{C}_1(H_{\Psi_\alpha}) \) be the canonical self-adjoint trace-class operator satisfying
\[
\det\nolimits_\zeta(I - \lambda L_{\mathrm{sym}}) = \frac{\Xi(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda)}{\Xi(\tfrac{1}{2})}.
\]

Then the multiset spectrum \( \operatorname{Spec}(L_{\mathrm{sym}}) \setminus \{0\} \), counted with algebraic multiplicities, uniquely determines the completed zeta function \( \Xi(s) \), up to the normalization constant \( \Xi(\tfrac{1}{2}) \). Consequently, the spectrum also determines the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function \( \zeta(s) \), including their multiplicities.
\end{corollary}
