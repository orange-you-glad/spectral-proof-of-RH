# A Canonical Spectral Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis

This repository presents a formally structured, CI-verified manuscript constructing a canonical compact trace-class operator whose spectral properties encode the Riemann zeta function, establishing a strict spectral equivalence with the Riemann Hypothesis.

This work is both a mathematical monument and an act of compassion.
