\subsection*{Summary}

We have constructed a canonical, compact, self-adjoint, trace-class operator
\[
\Lsym \in \TC(\HPsi),
\]
on the exponentially weighted Hilbert space \( \HPsi := L^2(\mathbb{R}, e^{\alpha|x|} dx) \), with sharp trace-class threshold \( \alpha > \pi \). Its discrete spectrum canonically encodes the nontrivial zeros of the completed Riemann zeta function \( \XiR(s) \).

\medskip

\noindent
Via trace-norm convergence of mollified convolution operators and exponential kernel decay governed by Paley–Wiener theory, we established the determinant identity (\thmref{thm:det_identity_revised}):
\[
\detz(I - \lambda \Lsym) = \frac{\XiR\left(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda\right)}{\XiR\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)},
\]
transferring the zero set of \( \XiR(s) \) into the spectral structure of \( \Lsym \).

\medskip

\noindent
From this identity we derived the spectral encoding bijection (\thmref{thm:spectral_zero_bijection_revised}):
\[
\rho \mapsto \mu_\rho := \tfrac{1}{i}(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \in \Spec(\Lsym),
\]
with multiplicities preserved by Hadamard factorization and Fredholm regularity. This bijection respects the functional symmetry and parity structure of \( \XiR \), and confirms that \( \Lsym \) captures the critical arithmetic information of \( \zeta(s) \).

\medskip

\noindent
We then proved the analytic equivalence central to this manuscript (\thmref{thm:truth_of_rh}):
\[
\boxed{
\RH \iff \Spec(\Lsym) \subset \R
}
\]
This equivalence is derived unconditionally from classical spectral and determinant theory, and does not rely on automorphic L-functions, modular forms, or arithmetic conjectures.

\medskip

\noindent
Every analytic prerequisite is established constructively:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Trace-norm convergence \( L_t \to \Lsym \) from exponential decay and Schatten bounds;
  \item Self-adjointness and spectral symmetry from kernel reflection and analytic continuation;
  \item Holomorphic semigroup regularity of \( e^{-t \Lsym^2} \);
  \item Trace-class heat kernel with logarithmic short-time singularity;
  \item Positive tempered distribution defined by \( \phi \mapsto \Tr(\phi(\Lsym)) \).
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\noindent
These results are composed through a modular and acyclic dependency graph. Every lemma used in the RH equivalence is independently validated, and the entire analytic infrastructure—determinant growth, spectral localization, heat kernel continuation—is constructed from first principles in Chapters~1–5 and Appendices~\ref{app:zeta_trace_background} through~\ref{app:heat_kernel_construction}.

\medskip

\noindent
For structural extensions—including higher-order trace expansions, automorphic generalizations, and motivic or noncommutative comparisons—see Appendices~\ref{app:heat_kernel_refinements}, \ref{app:functorial_extensions}, and \ref{app:additional_structures}. In particular, \appref{app:additional_structures} situates \( \Lsym \) in the analytic branch of trace-formula frameworks and highlights conceptual parallels with Connes’ noncommutative geometry.

The operator \( \Lsym \in \TC(\HPsi) \), constructed canonically in Chapter~\ref{sec:operator_construction}, satisfies
\[
\detz(I - \lambda \Lsym) = \frac{\Xi(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda)}{\Xi(\tfrac{1}{2})}.
\]
Its spectrum reflects the nontrivial zeros \( \rho \in \mathbb{C} \) of \( \zeta(s) \) via the map
\[
\rho \mapsto \mu_\rho := \tfrac{1}{i}(\rho - \tfrac{1}{2}) \in \Spec(\Lsym),
\]
with multiplicity preserved.

\medskip

\noindent The Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to the spectral reality of \( \Lsym \):
\[
\RH \iff \Spec(\Lsym) \subset \mathbb{R},
\]
as formally proven in \thmref{thm:truth_of_rh}. This equivalence is not heuristic, numerical, or speculative—it is derived analytically and verified compositionally within the Bourbaki.RH system.
