\section{Additional Structures and Future Directions}
\label{app:additional_structures}

\noindent\textbf{[Noncritical Appendix]}  
This appendix is logically inert: no theorem, lemma, or proof in the main manuscript depends on this material. It records speculative extensions of the canonical spectral framework to broader arithmetic contexts and conjectural cohomological models. These ideas are exploratory and intended to guide future investigations, rather than to serve as established results.

\subsection*{Spectral Generalizations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Functorial \( L \)-Functions.}  
  Given a completed automorphic \( L \)-function \( \Lambda_\pi(s) \), one may conjecturally define a spectral envelope
  \[
  \Psi_\pi(x) := \left| \Lambda_\pi\left( \tfrac{1}{2} + i x \right) \right|^2, \quad
  H_{\Psi_\pi} := L^2(\R, \Psi_\pi(x) dx),
  \]
  and postulate the existence of a compact, self-adjoint, trace-class operator \( L_\pi \in \TC(H_{\Psi_\pi}) \) satisfying
  \[
  \detz(I - \lambda L_\pi) = \frac{\Lambda_\pi(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda)}{\Lambda_\pi(\tfrac{1}{2})}.
  \]
  This would generalize the canonical determinant identity established for \( \XiR(s) \) in \cref{sec:determinant_identity}, and is explored heuristically in \appref{app:functorial_extensions}.

  \item \textbf{Cohomological Realization over \( \Spec(\Z) \).}  
  In the frameworks proposed by Deninger~\cite{Deninger1998Frobenius}, one expects a Frobenius-type operator \( \mathrm{Frob} \) acting on a hypothetical cohomology of \( \Spec(\Z) \), satisfying a trace formula
  \[
  \det\nolimits_{\mathrm{reg}}(I - u \cdot \mathrm{Frob}) = \zeta(u),
  \]
  analogous to the Lefschetz formula in Ã©tale cohomology. In this view, \( \Lsym \) might admit interpretation as a spectral or Laplace-type realization of such a Frobenius operator, consistent with the trace formula perspective of Connes~\cite{Connes1999TraceFormula}.

  \item \textbf{Higher-Rank Langlands Extensions.}  
  For a reductive group \( G \), one may conjecture the existence of a canonical operator \( L_{\sym,G} \in \TC(H_{\Psi_G}) \) such that
  \[
  \detz(I - \lambda L_{\sym,G}) = \frac{\Lambda^G(\tfrac{1}{2} + i\lambda)}{\Lambda^G(\tfrac{1}{2})},
  \]
  where \( \Lambda^G(s) \) denotes the Langlands \( L \)-function attached to \( G \) or its dual group \( {}^LG \). Such operators could emerge from trace formulas, moduli of shtukas, or categorified spectral constructions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Outlook}

The canonical determinant identity derived here for \( \XiR(s) \) suggests a broader framework in which global \( L \)-functions admit trace-class operator realizations. If such spectral models can be constructed uniformly, they may offer a pathway toward unifying:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Analytic continuation and functional equations via determinant regularization;
  \item Spectral encodings of zero multiplicities via Fredholm factorization;
  \item Functorial correspondences in the Langlands program via analytic operators or categorical traces.
\end{itemize}

These directions remain conjectural and speculative. They are not used in the analytic realization of the Riemann Hypothesis presented in this manuscript but may serve as conceptual guideposts for future arithmetic, analytic, and categorical developments.
