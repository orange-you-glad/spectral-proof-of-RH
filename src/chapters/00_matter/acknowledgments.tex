\section*{Acknowledgments}

The author gratefully acknowledges the foundational analytic frameworks in spectral theory, operator ideals, and analytic number theory that underlie the structure of this work.

Profound appreciation is extended to B.~Ya.~Levin for the theory of entire functions, to Barry Simon and Michael Reed for the architecture of trace ideals and self-adjoint operators, and to E.~C.~Titchmarsh and H.~M.~Edwards for their enduring expositions on the Riemann zeta function.

Special inspiration for the spectral interpretation of zeta-function zeros comes from Peter Sarnak, whose work on the arithmetic and spectral theory of automorphic forms continues to illuminate the profound connections between number theory, geometry, and quantum physics.

The construction of the canonical operator \( L_{\mathrm{sym}} \), the analysis of its heat trace asymptotics, and the realization of \( \Xi(s) \) as a zeta-regularized determinant are grounded in these analytic legacies.

The analytic structure of this manuscript aspires to reflect the modular clarity and conceptual depth modeled by these influences.
